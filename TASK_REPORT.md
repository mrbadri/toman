# Interview Task Submission

Hi!

I hope you're doing well.

Thank you for this opportunity to participate in the interview task. Below, I have outlined my approach and implementation details.


## Requirements

- [x] **React**
- [x] **TypeScript**
- [x] **Routing**
- [ ] **State Management** – I implemented this in `frontend/src/app/dashboard/payments/store/payment-filter-store.ts` but didn’t use it because all requirements can be handled with search params, which I believe is a better approach.
- [x] **Pagination**
- [x] **Filters**
- [x] **State Persistence**

---

## Bonus Points

- [x] **Fancy UI**
- [x] **Modern UI Libraries**
- [x] **Responsive Design**

---

## Additional Work

- [x] **Fixed CORS issue on the backend**
- [x] **Added multi-filter support for type and status**
- [x] **Implemented scroll pagination** 
- [x] **Dockerized the application**
- [x] **Deployed on an Ubuntu server**
- [x] **Added a script for API generation** 
    - You can test this with:  
        ```sh
        yarn run gen:api
        ```
- [x] **Implemented light mode and dark mode support**
